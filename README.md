 Virtual Herbal Garden
The Virtual Herbal Garden is an interactive digital platform designed to showcase medicinal plants in a visually engaging and informative way. It provides users with detailed information about plants used in various traditional medicine systems under AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy). The project combines educational content, 3D visualization, and modern web technologies to create a rich and immersive user experience.

 Objective
The main goal of the Virtual Herbal Garden is to make learning about medicinal plants accessible and engaging for students, researchers, and the general public. By integrating interactive 3D models, detailed descriptions, and multimedia resources, the platform bridges the gap between traditional knowledge and digital technology.

 Key Features
Interactive 3D Models: View plants in 3D for a realistic representation.

Detailed Plant Information: Includes descriptions, scientific names, medicinal uses, and categories.

Search & Filter Options: Quickly find plants by name, category, or medicinal property.

Multimedia Integration: Supports images, videos, and audio clips for a richer learning experience.

Responsive Design: Optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

 Database
